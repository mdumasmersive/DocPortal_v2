        <h1>Solstice Conference Physical Setup</h1>
        <p>Now that Solstice Conference has been configured, you can move on to the physical setup. Solstice Conference has been designed to be used in small meeting spaces, such as huddle rooms, or larger more complex conference rooms. See below for physical setup tips, as well as how to setup a standard Solstice Conference room. </p>
        <h2>Physical Setup Tips</h2>
        <p>Because the Pod does not store user credential information, unencrypted passwords, or users’ data that has been shared to the display, the physical Pods do not have to be located in secure locations. However, other considerations related to theft and environmental conditions should be considered.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solstice Conference supports plug-and-plug USB&#160;devices. Devices, such as room cameras, should be connected to the Pod via USB and must be in-room. <a href="https://documentation.mersive.com/content/topics/solstice-conference-supported-peripherals.htm">View list of supported devices.</a> Note:&#160;DSPs and other processing hubs may not be compatible and should be avoided. </li>
            <li>Display monitors must be directly connected to a Solstice Pod through HDMI video cables. If using a single display monitor, Mersive recommends connecting the display monitor to the inner HDMI&#160;port. </li>

        <h3>How to Physically Install Solstice Conference</h3>
        <p>Follow the steps below for an example of how to physically install Solstice Conference in a standard room configuration. For assistance with more complex room setups, contact your AV/IT integrator or Mersive Support. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Plug the Solstice Pod into your network via Ethernet (PoE+ supported). </li>
