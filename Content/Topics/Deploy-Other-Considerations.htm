        <h1>Other Considerations</h1>
        <p>Below are some best practices that should be taken into account or performed after deploying Solstice.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want to learn more about how to enable and use Solstice Conference, see our <a href="Solstice-Conference-Introduction.htm">Solstice Conference Guide</a>. </li>
            <li>If you want to learn more about how to enable and use Solstice Active Learning, see our <a href="Active-Learning-Introduction.htm">Solstice Active Learning Guide</a>. </li>
            <li>Depending on your network security policy, you may need to export a list of the Solstice displays' MAC addresses and provide it to your network team so they can whitelist them on the network. You can export the list from the Solstice Dashboard. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">For more information, see <a href="Admin-GetStarted-Dashboard.htm">Getting Started with Solstice Dashboard</a>. </MadCap:conditionalText></li>
            <li>If you centrally manage PC-based client applications, Mersive provides an  MSI&#160;installer for the Solstice App. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">For more information, see <a href="Admin-MSI-Instuctions.htm">Installing the Solstice App with MSI</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText></li>
