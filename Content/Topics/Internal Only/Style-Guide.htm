        <h2>Notes, Tips, Warnings </h2>
        <p>The CSS&#160;stylesheet for this project (styles.css) has 3 additional paragraph &lt;p&gt; style classes to help distinguish important information such as notes, tips, or warnings that we do not want to get lost in the main paragraph or how-to. </p>
        <p class="note">Notes are used to communicate important information about a feature or workflow to the admin or end-user that we do not want them to miss. </p>
        <p class="tip"> Tips are used to call out best practices or additional tips that might make the process easier for the reader. For example: In Solstice Cloud, you can assign your Pods to categories, such as location or floor level, to make configuration easier. </p>
        <p class="warning">Warnings are used to communicate critical information, typically to administrators, to let them know if there are any caveats or mis-steps that might negatively affect their Solstice deployment or the functionality of the product. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To apply a note, tip, or warning to the text:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure the text has its own &lt;p&gt; line. This can be visually confirmed in the XML&#160;Editor view of the topic as the line should have a 'p' node visible on the left-hand side of the topic. </li>
            <li>Click the line's 'p' node to select the entire line. </li>
            <li>In the Flare toolbar menu, go to <b>Home</b> &gt;&#160;<b>Style</b> drop-down, then select either <b>p.note</b>, <b>p.tip</b>, or <b>p.warning</b>. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Drop-down Text</h2>
        <p>Drop-downs are typically used within a topic for three things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When there are two or more how-to's </li>
            <li>When there is one or more FAQ </li>
            <li>Within quickstart or deployment topics, to conceal dense and technical information </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Capitalization</h2>
        <p>Capitalize all proper names, including 'Pod', and all product names. </p>
        <p> When referring to GUI elements, match the capitalization used in the interface.</p>
        <p>Use title-case capitalization for headings.</p>
        <h2>Abbreviations</h2>
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
