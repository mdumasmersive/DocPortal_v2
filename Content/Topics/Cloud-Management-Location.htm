        <h1>Pod Location Configuration Settings</h1>
        <p>Location features in Solstice Cloud use GPS estimates that are learned from Location Services to automatically group your Pods into categories for Country, City, and Building. These categories will behave just like other categories except they’ll be populated automatically and don’t require editing. This allows a user to walk into a room, open the Solstice app, and see the Pod they are physically closest to at the top of the display list. If the automatic categories aren't intuitive enough for your users, you can assign a “friendly name” for each  building which end users will see when they open the Solstice app. </p>
        <p>Additionally, for administrative purposes, Solstice Cloud admins can easily segment groups of Pods based on their location while managing template configurations, viewing usage analytics, monitoring uptime, and much more. Using an interactive map admins can see how Pods are clustered together based on their location, and they can fine tune the location of a pod down to a few feet or even identify which floor of the building the pod is on.</p>
        <p>The use of Location Services requires the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pods must be imported into Solstice Cloud</li>
            <li>Pods need location services enabled (Manage &gt; Templates &gt; Features &gt; Room Services)</li>
            <li>Pods must be running Solstice 5.1 or greater</li>
        </ul>

                    <li>Click on one of the clusters of pods or building icons to zoom in on the map. Continue clicking on clusters until the map shows individual Pods or until you the level of detail you want to see appears.<p class="note">The Cluster by Buildings display may not represent all Pods as some Pods may not yet have a building assignment. However, all the Pods that have been imported into Solstice cloud will be represented on the map with an estimated initial location. The Cluster by Buildings display will begin to display these individual Pods when it is with two stops of maximum zoom.</p></li>
                    <li>Click on an individual Pod to display the Pod Configuration page.</li>
