        <h1>Designing an Active Learning Room</h1>
        <p> Once the Pods have been connected to their team table displays and deployed on the network, Active Learning Designers can  virtually design and enable a new active learning space using the Solstice Active Learning app's intuitive drag-and-drop interface. </p>
        <p class="note">To create and design rooms within the Solstice Active Learning app, users must first be invited to create an account by a Solstice Cloud administrator and  assigned the Active Learning Designer user role. </p>
