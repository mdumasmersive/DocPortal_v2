        <p>To import the Pods into the Dashboard, both the Pods and the Windows computer that the Dashboard is installed on must be powered on and connected to the same network. </p>
        <p>The easiest way to import Solstice Pods into the Dashboard is to get the Pods onto the network via Ethernet. Some administrators prefer to configure Pods using a closed loop network, but it is not required. The Pod comes with Ethernet enabled by default, so connecting an active network jack should result in an automatic network connection that will allow you to easily import the Pods. </p>
        <p>If you are unable to put the Pods on a network via Ethernet, the recommended method is to individually connect the Pods to the network wirelessly via the Pod's local configuration panel. Once the Pods are on the network, they can then be imported into the Dashboard to be configured and managed. </p>
        <p class="note">The Dashboard separates all instances into groups based on Pod vs. Software instances, Small Group Edition (SGE) vs. Unlimited, Solstice software version numbers, and unsupported instances. Each group of instances has slightly different configuration options, so only instances from the same group can be configured together. </p>
        <p class="note">Selecting multiple instances at once allows you to batch configure them for most settings. If multiple displays are selected in the Dashboard instances panel but their existing settings are different for a given configuration option, the field will display a dash (—). </p>
