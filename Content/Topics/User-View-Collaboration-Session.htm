        <p>For participants who are not in the same room as the display, Solstice currently provides an option to “look in” to the meeting via a web browser. If the Look-In option has been enabled for the display, there are two ways to access it:&#160;via the Solstice App or a web browser.</p>
        <p class="note">The Remote Look-In view is not instantaneous and updates every ~5 seconds. Depending on your organization's security policies, you may not have access to this feature. </p>
