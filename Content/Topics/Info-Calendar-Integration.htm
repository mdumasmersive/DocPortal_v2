        <h1>Calendar Integration</h1>
        <p>Integrating a room calendar with your Solstice display allows you to display  the schedule and calendar information for the room when there is no other content being shared. Participants can see if the space is currently scheduled or available, as well as the next three upcoming meetings in the space. Room calendar integrations support Microsoft Exchange, Office 365, and Google Workspace calendars and can be configured by a Solstice administrator using either Solstice Cloud or the Solstice Dashboard. </p>
        <p>If using Solstice Conference, integrating a room also lets Solstice detect  the web conferencing information in the calendar invite when users book a web conference and invite the room. This allows Solstice to start the scheduled web conferencing with the meeting host connects to the Solstice display. This same functionality is also applied to personal O365 calendar integrations that users can configure in their Solstice app (requires the Solstice App version 5.0 or later; supported for Windows or MacOS laptops only). </p>
