        <h1>View and Manage USB&#160;Devices</h1>
        <p>Solstice Cloud allows you to easily view which Pods in your deployment are connected to which kinds of USB devices, both audio/video devices and other devices, such as input and storage peripherals. Knowing which Pods have connected cameras allows you to then enable Solstice Conference and occupancy counting in the <a href="Cloud-Template-Room-Intelligence.htm">Room Intelligence options</a> for those Pods. User can view USB&#160;Devices data in the initial deployment of this feature, and management functionality is coming soon.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>USB Devices Summary Data</h2>
        <p>Solstice Cloud reports the number and type of USB&#160;devices connected to the Solstice Pods in your organization, both online and offline, as well as details about specific USB devices that have been used on Pods in your organization. The three boxes at the top of the USB Devices page contain summary data about USB&#160;devices connected to your Pods.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Online USB Devices</b> The summary box on the left reports the number and type of USB&#160;devices connected to Pods in your organization that are currently online. Solstice categorizes these devices into A/V (audio/video) and Non-A/V types.</li>
            <li><b>USB&#160;Device Status</b> The circle chart in the Device Status box provides an at-a-glance summary of online/offline status for all USB&#160;devices that have been plugged into both online and offline Pods in your organization.</li>
            <li><b>USB&#160;Device Models</b> The right-hand box summarizes the numbers of specific USB&#160;device models you have connected to your Pods, provided in both a list and a handy graph. This makes it easy to see which devices you have the most of in your Solstice deployment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below the USB&#160;devices summary information, the <b>USB&#160;Plug Event History</b> graph shows the number of the times USB&#160;devices have been plugged in to or unplugged from your organization's Pods each day for the last 30 days. Hover over the lines for a particular day to see exact plug-in/unplug event numbers.</p>
        <h2>USB Devices Table Details</h2>
        <p>The Devices table at the bottom of the USB Devices page provides more details about each of the USB&#160;devices that have been connected to the Solstice Pods in your organization, including each device's details, current status, and the readiness of the associated Pod for Solstice Conference and occupancy data functionality. </p>
        <p>The USB Devices data can be sorted by the values in each column to find Pods and USB&#160;devices that meet various criteria by clicking the <img src="../Resources/Images/I_sortIcon.png" alt="black sort up-and-down arrow" /> icon in the column header. Possible sorts include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alphabetically by the <b>Pod</b> name (default)</li>
            <li>Alphabetically by <b>USB&#160;Device</b> (groups similarly named USB&#160;devices together)</li>
            <li>By online/offline status in the <b>USB&#160;Status</b> column: A red dot <img src="../Resources/Images/i_reddot.png" style="width: 16px;height: 16px;" alt="red status dot icon" />  indicates the USB&#160;device is offline. Hovering over a red or green status dot displays the status in text format.</li>
            <li>By the date and time in the <b>Since</b> column, when the USB&#160;device was last plugged in to or unplugged from the Pod</li>
            <li>By whether the Pod connected to a USB&#160;device is <b>Conference Ready</b>: A green check<img src="../Resources/Images/i_checkmark.png" style="width: 24px;height: auto;" alt="green checkmark icon" />indicates all hardware, software, and configuration requirements for Solstice Conference functionality have been met. Hover over the <img src="../Resources/Images/i_no.png" alt="No (?)" /> status to see which Solstice Conference requirements have not yet been met.</li>
            <li>By whether the Pod connected to a USB&#160;device is <b>Occupancy Ready</b>:  A green check<img src="../Resources/Images/i_checkmark.png" style="width: 24px;height: auto;" alt="green checkmark icon" />indicates the software and configuration requirements to report conference space occupancy data in the <a href="Cloud-Analytics.htm">Solstice Cloud Analytics information</a> have been met. Hover over the <img src="../Resources/Images/i_no.png" alt="No (?)" /> status to see which requirements for occupancy counting have not yet been met.
              <p class="warning">No camera data such as video or audio captures ever leave the Pod. All processing occurs locally and only the aggregated occupancy count is sent to your Solstice Cloud account.</p></li>
        </ul>
