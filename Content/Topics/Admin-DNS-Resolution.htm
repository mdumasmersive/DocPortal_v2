        <h1>DNS Resolution</h1>
        <p>Summary paragraph about what DNS is and why it's important to Solstice. </p>
        <p>In order to utilize DNS resolution for your Solstice display, there are two methods:</p>
        <p>If your networks utilize one DNS&#160;server</p>
        <p>If your networks utilize multiple DNS&#160;servers</p>
        <p>-automatic DNS&#160;resolution within Solstice. If all network interfaces you want to use DNS for share the same DNS server, you can have Solstice automatically resolve and display the DNS&#160;entries for each network interface on the welcome screen. This requires editing the hostname value (system tab dashboard) to match your desired DNS&#160;hostname. If utilizing static IP addresses, IT admins will need to create the DNS entry that matches that same hostname value on their internal DNS server. Be sure to create a reverse DNS entry for the Pod to be able to find its hostname. This hostname will then be passed to your DNS server from each network interface. If you enable display DNS hostname (display tab), you can display short or fully qualified domain names. this will only work if the DNS value returned matches on all network interfaces. </p>
        <p>Mersive highly recommends using SDS if implementing DNS&#160;resolution. </p>
        <p>^^ change/reference the hostname. select the DNS option. if static IP, enter each network interface, add the internal DNS server IP address. </p>
        <p>-manual entry of DNS hostname into Pod/Dashboard for each connected network interface. Must be applied individually and will differ from Pod to Pod due to unique hostname. Can differ from interface to interface if utilizing different domain names. This requires admins to completely configure all DNS entries on their network prior to entering the desired display hostname in Dashboard. </p>
        <p>If you wish to utilize DNS&#160;resolution  and have added a DNS&#160;entry in your DNS&#160;server to resolve to the Pod's IP&#160;address, you can enter in the <b>DNS&#160;Hostname</b> (for example, hostname.domain) that you wish to show on the display's welcome screen. For more information on DNS&#160;resolution, see DNS&#160;Resolution. </p>
        <p>^^ enter in the hostname. in network, make sure dns entry in dns server is able to resolve to the pod's IP address. </p>
        <p>Enable “Use DNS for my welcome screen if DNS returns successfully” so that users will enter the DNS name and not an IP Address to QuickConnect. </p>
        <p>DNS&#160;resolution is only supported when all interfaces utilize the same DNS&#160;server. The A records have to match for each network interface in order for us to display a single DNS&#160;entry that can be used across all interfaces. </p>
        <p>simplest way for this to happen: </p>
        <p>Static. </p>
        <p>Dynamic. in envir where dhcp server receives hostname from device that joins network and creates a DNS entry that matches to the IP address that it gives to the device to setup DNS name resolution for the Pod, you'll need to do the following. When the Pod receives its IP address via a DHCP server, the DHCP server then creates a corresponding DNS&#160;entry. in system tab, replace default hostname w/ your preferred hostname (typically matches the display/room name) because it will be displayed to end-users instead of the IP address. </p>
        <p>if all users are on the same domain that the pod is on, you can choose to use the short form DNS vs. the fully qualified domain name. (note for me: all devices on a domain have their hostnames appended with the fully qualified domain name) &gt; is this on </p>
        <p>single network &gt;&#160;enter hostname for device, the hostname is reported to DNS server, then can enable DNS&#160;in the display tab of dashboard. as long as the Pod finds a DNS entry that matches the hostname of the Pod, it iwll display your DNS&#160;entry in place of the IP&#160;address in the connection instructions on the&#160;Pod's welcome screen</p>
        <p>^ in same scenario, if you want to utilize 2 diff network connections, the workflow is the same, but in order to display a DNS&#160;entry, the DNS name has to match for all network interfaces on the Pod, it can display a single DNS entry on the the Pod's welcome screen. DNS names have to match across the board. it should, because hostname is transferred to the server. If a DNS entry is not found, or does not match the expected result, you will see a yellow text warning under the option to enable it in Dashboard. </p>
