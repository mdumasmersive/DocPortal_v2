        <h1>Solstice Cloud Analytics: In-Room Tech</h1>
        <p>The In-Room Tech Analytics page allows you see how teams collaborate when they come together in meeting and learning spaces by providing data on the types of devices that are connecting to your organization's Solstice Pods, and the methods that are being used to share content. Additionally, for Pods that are being used to support web conferencing, you can display data about the number of meetings that use conferencing (i.e. "hybrid meetings) as well as the web conferencing platforms that are shared to Solstice (e.g. Zoom, Teams, etc.). <MadCap:expanding><MadCap:expandingHead>Example</MadCap:expandingHead><MadCap:expandingBody><br /><img src="../Resources/Images/SolsticeCloudInRoomTech.png" style="width: 839px;height: 597px;" /></MadCap:expandingBody></MadCap:expanding> </p>
        <h2>Collected Data</h2>
        <p>Solstice data is uploaded to Solstice Cloud on a daily basis. After it is uploaded to Solstice Cloud, the data is deleted from the Solstice Pod. Solstice Cloud tracks the following  data for Solstice Pods.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the upper-left hand corner of the In-Room Tech table, enter text in the Search field.<img src="../Resources/Images/AnalyticsInRoomTechSearchTable.png" style="width: 680px;height: 471px;" /></li>
                </ol>
                <p>A filter is set and the table shows the Pods that match your text.</p>
                <p class="note">The search filter matches text that may not be displayed on the page. For example, if the text you enter matches a option specified in a category, then that Pod will be included in the list.  If it is not apparent why Pods are matching your search text, use the Filter feature on the In-Room Tech Analytics page to look at the Filter by Category options that may be matching your query.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>By default, data from all the Pods being managed by Solstice Cloud is included in the charts and graphs. You can include or exclude the data from  a specific Pod or Pods by manually checking or unchecking the box to the left of the Pod name in the Displays table. </p>
                <p class="note">Only checked Pods are included in the data that is graphed. </p>
                <p>You can also check or uncheck the "select all" box to the right of the Name column header to select or clear all checked Pods</p>
