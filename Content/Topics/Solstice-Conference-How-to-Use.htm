        <h1>How to Use Solstice Conference</h1>
        <p>These instructions outline steps for <b>meeting hosts</b> to use Solstice Conference to bridge their web or video conference to Solstice. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Scheduled Conferences vs. Non-Scheduled Conferences</h3>
        <p>Scheduled conferences are those which are scheduled on a room calendar integrated with a Solstice Pod, or those which are scheduled on a personal calendar integrated in the Solstice app. The details for the conference - e.g. Meeting ID, Passcode, etc. - need to be included in the body of the scheduled event. Clicking <b>Start</b> will connect the Pod to the scheduled conference (see <a href="#Launch">Launch a Scheduled Web Conference</a>). If conflicting conferences are scheduled simultaneously in the Pod's calendar and in the meeting host computer calendar, the Solstice app will start the conference specified for the meeting host computer.</p>
        <p>Mersive recommends that you start Solstice Conferences using scheduled conferences. </p>
        <p>However, Solstice can also "bridge" into a non-scheduled conference. If a remote conference is currently in progress, you can connect to the Pod and then click <b>Bridge without a calendar event,</b> and then click <b>Start</b>. After you are connected to Solstice you can then connect to the remote conference using your conferencing application and share the Solstice screen with the conference. (See <a href="#Bridge">Bridge an In-progress Meeting to Solstice Conference</a>.)</p>
        <h3><a name="Using"></a>Using Solstice Conference with Dual Displays</h3>
        <p>If the Pod is using dual displays, the display shared to the conference will be the display connected to HDMI 1 of the Pod. The screen connected to HDMI 2 will be labeled as a Private Display and will be visible to participants in the room but will not be shared as part of the conference. In the Solstice app layout screen, the display shared with the conference is the screen on the left.</p>
