        <p>The Solstice Dashboard for Enterprise Edition is a centralized management tool that can be used to monitor, configure, and update Solstice Enterprise Edition Pods and Windows Software instances on a network. While each Solstice display can be configured individually via its local configuration panel, the Solstice Dashboard streamlines the deployment process and allows IT administrators to manage their deployment from a central location. </p>
