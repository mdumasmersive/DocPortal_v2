        <h1>Get Started with Solstice Active Learning</h1>
        <p>Solstice Active Learning is a software-enabled active routing solution for multi-team learning environments that allows educators to control, share, and engage with students. The application provides a simple active learning space design tool, drag-and-drop video sharing between screens, and an instant messaging system that can broadcast information to each display on demand.  </p>
        <p>Solstice Active Learning can be enabled on Solstice Gen3 Pods with software version 4.5 or later with a current Active Learning subscription.  Additionally, each designer and facilitator must have a Solstice Cloud account in order to virtually design rooms and route video in real-time using the free Active Learning app. </p>
        <p class="note">Each Active Learning video routing connection is counted towards the licensed number of connections/users for the Pod. For example, Solstice Pods with SGE (Small Group Edition) licensing will allow up to four total connections to it, including those from active video routing. For Solstice Pods with Unlimited user licensing, the maximum number of Active Learning video routing connections is 8; however, an unlimited amount of Solstice users will be able to connect and share to that individual Pod.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Deploy the Active Learning app with MSI</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><a name="ActiveLearningMSI"></a>The MSI installer package of the Solstice Active Learning app allows for a GUI-based installation on a local machine or GPO deployment in Active Directory. This allows your IT administrator to centrally deploy the Active Learning app on Windows machines and can be set to install silently.   The installer does need privileges to install system-wide, but the installer does not explicitly check for these privileges.  This makes it easier to use the MSI in a remote deployment where either an administrator or the SYSTEM account can install this properly.  </p>
                <p>The MSI&#160;allows you to set the following installation parameter:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>INSTALLDIR=</b> controls where the client will be installed.  The default is: “C:\Program Files (x86)\Mersive Technologies, Inc\Active Learning\”.  Note:  The string “INSTALLDIR” must be written in capital letters.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The client-specific data that was stored in each user’s home directory will now be stored in a central shared location.  This allows for centralized management of these settings and the ability to update them for all users at installation time.  </p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p class="codeblock">msiexec /i ActiveLearning.msi INSTALLDIR=”C:\Program Files (x86)\Mersive Technologies, Inc\Active Learning” /quiet /log c:\ActiveLearningClient.log</p>
                <p>The above example will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Silently install the client in the directory C:\Program Files (x86)\ActiveLearning</li>
                    <li>Write an installation log file named C:\ActiveLearningClient.log</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If stepping through the InstallShield wizard, the installation directory can also be set on the installer's Destination Folder dialog page. </p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Each Solstice Active Learning user should have a unique login. Mersive does not recommend creating a universal guest account for guest facilitators. </p>
