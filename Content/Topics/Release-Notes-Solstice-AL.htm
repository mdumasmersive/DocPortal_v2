                <h4>New Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Enhanced In-Room Security.</b> Active Learning Administrators can now enable Solstice's screen key feature to require a screen key to be entered into the Active Learning app when a Facilitator attempts to connect to the room. The facilitator can enter a screen key displayed on any of the team table displays in the room in order to connect. This feature can be enabled in Solstice Cloud &gt;&#160;Active Learning tab.</li>
                    <li><b>Quicker Room Creation.</b> An Active Learning Administrator can now duplicate team blocks or entire room configurations. To remove some of the repetitive tasks in creating and configuring an Active Learning room, the administrator can duplicate a team block to keep layouts consistent and make team block creation less tedious. Similarly, in the case that a building has similar room layouts, the administrator can duplicate an entire room configuration.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Fixes and Enhancements</h4>

                </ul>

                    <li>Reduced disconnects when mirroring.</li>
                </ul>
