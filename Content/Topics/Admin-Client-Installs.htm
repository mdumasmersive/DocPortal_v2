        <h1>Deploy the Solstice App with MSI&#160;or SCCM</h1>
        <p>For ease in centrally deploying the Solstice App, Mersive provides both an MSI and an SCCM installer package of the Solstice App for Windows. The MSI&#160;installer package allows for a GUI-based installation on a local machine or GPO deployment in Active Directory, while the SCCM&#160;installer package allows for a remote installation. Either of these methods can be used to deploy the Solstice App silently by your IT&#160;administrator. Click on one of the topics below to learn more about how to centrally deploy the Solstice App using one of these methods. </p>
