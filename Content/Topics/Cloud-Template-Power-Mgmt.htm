        <h1>Power Management Template</h1>
        <p>Power management templates allow you to schedule  when a Pod's display monitor will turn off after being idle for the specified amount of time. Solstice can do this using one of two methods: suspending the HDMI signal being sent to the display, which allows the display monitors  to use their own sleep settings, or by sending an RS-232 command to the display to turn off. The display will turn back on if any activity occurs. Power Management options are available for Gen2i and Gen3 Pods.</p>
        <p class="note">If a calendar integration has been enabled on the Pod, and a meeting is scheduled, the Pod will not suspend the display. Even if no one has connected to the Pod, and even if a Pod that is configured to detect room occupancy does not detect anyone in the room, the display will not be suspend until after the scheduled meeting has ended.</p>

                <p>Occupancy-based display power management allows Solstice to leverage its room occupancy detection capability to automatically sleep or wake the room display when employees enter and exit the meeting room. To enable this capability, you will first need to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plug a supported USB camera into the Pod on Solstice version 5.1 or later</li>
                    <li>Ensure occupancy data has been enabled for the Pod (Features template)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To enable display power management based on room occupancy:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>From the Power Management template, select the <b>Enable Display Power Management</b> checkbox.</li>
                    <li>From the <b>Select How Power Management is Enabled</b> drop-down, select <b>Based on room occupancy</b>.</li>
                    <li>From the next drop-down, select the select the amount of time after the room is determined to be unoccupied before the display is suspended. <p class="warning">Mersive advises against using the Immediate option, as this could trigger the display to turn off if the camera is temporarily blocked. Occupancy is detected every 10 seconds, so there may be a delay before the display reawakens.</p></li>
                    <li>From the <b>Choose Suspend Method</b> options, select the method you wish to use to signal display monitors to turn off:<ul><li><b>Suspend HDMI&#160;Signal</b> - The Solstice Pod will suspend the HDMI out signal, allowing the display monitors  to use their own sleep settings. </li><li><b>RS-232</b> - The Solstice Pod will send the RS-232 commands you enter to the display monitor to turn it on and off. </li></ul></li>
                    <li>If the RS-232 option was selected, enter in the RS-232 codes to turn your display monitor on and off in the corresponding fields that appear below. Solstice will use them to turn the display on or off. ASCII and HEX codes are both supported.</li>
