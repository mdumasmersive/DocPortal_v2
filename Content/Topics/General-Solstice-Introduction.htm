        <h2>Configuring Solstice Displays</h2>
        <p>There are multiple ways that you can configure a Solstice Pod. You can configure the Pod without a network by plugging a USB mouse and keyboard directly into the Pod. However, Mersive recommends using the Solstice Dashboard to configure your Pods in order to streamline deployment and management.</p>
        <p>There are a few methods to access your Pod’s configuration settings. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Individually configured:</b> Every Solstice Pod can be configured via the individual Pod’s configuration panel. The Pod's configuration panel can be accessed by connecting a USB mouse and keyboard to the Pod, or 	by entering the Pod’s IP address into a web browser, then clicking the Settings icon   in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. If the presence bar at the bottom of the Solstice screen is hidden, you can use the mouse to long click or hit the Esc button on your keyboard to show the presence bar and access the Pod's local settings. </li>
            <li><b>Centrally configured via the Solstice Cloud portal:</b> <a href="Cloud-Introduction.htm">Solstice Cloud</a> is a secure cloud-based portal that allows you to centrally manage your deployment from any location. Solstice Cloud allow administrators to easily deploy, manage, monitor, and update Solstice Pods, and also provides intuitive analytics on your Solstice meetings. </li>
            <li><b>Centrally configured via the Solstice Dashboard:</b>&#160;For admins who need an on-premises solution, or who are unable to utilize cloud-based management, <a href="Admin-GetStarted-Dashboard.htm">Solstice Dashboard</a> is a centralized management tool installed on a local machine or server that can be used to monitor, configure, and update Solstice Enterprise Edition Pods and Windows Software instances over the local network. Instead of individually configuring each Solstice display via its local configuration panel, the Solstice Dashboard streamlines the deployment process and allows IT administrators to manage their deployment from an on-premises, central location. </li>
