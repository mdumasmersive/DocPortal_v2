    <body>
        <h1>Solstice Cloud Analytics: Usage</h1>
        <p>The  <b>Usage</b> page allows you to see a graph of  Pod usage history. Up to two types of analytics data can be displayed simultaneously on the graph, and the types of data displayed are selectable using drop-downs. <MadCap:expanding><MadCap:expandingHead>Example</MadCap:expandingHead><MadCap:expandingBody><br /><img src="../Resources/Images/SolsticeCloudUsage.png" style="width: 785px;height: 710px;" /></MadCap:expandingBody></MadCap:expanding></p>
        <p>The Usage page is divided into two main parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Usage History Graph</b> - This is a graph at the top half of the page that displays up to two types of data on a time line.</li>
            <li><b>Displays Table</b> - This table can list all the Pods that are being managed in your Solstice Cloud instance, or it can display a filtered subset of Pods. Any filters you apply will affect the data that is displayed in the table. Clicking the check-boxes to the left of filtered Pods will show only the data from the selected Pods on the graph.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Collected Data</h2>
        <p>Solstice data is uploaded to Solstice Cloud on a daily basis. After it is uploaded to Solstice Cloud, the data is deleted from the Solstice Pod. Solstice Cloud tracks the following  data for Solstice Pods.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>In the left sidebar menu of the Solstice Cloud portal, go to <b>Analytics</b> &gt; <b>Usage</b>. The Usage History graph displays.</li>
                    <li>The data shown is determined by what displays are selected in the Displays table below the graph. You can select or deselect displays manually or filter them by their assigned categories. Only the data for the displays selected will appear in the graph.</li>
                    <li>To change the graph view, you can select to view the data in Hours, Days, Weeks, or Months in the top left-hand corner of the graph. You can also select whether to view data from the last 48 hours, week, month, quarter, or a customer date range in the top right-hand corner of the graph.</li>
                    <li>To change the data shown in the graph, click one of the drop-downs in the bottom left-hand corner of the graph and select an option from the list that appears. For example, you can select to view "Content Per Meeting."</li>
                    <li>The second drop-down allows you to select another data column to compare the first column to. For example, you can select to view "Total Users." In this example, this will give you a side-by-side comparison of how the total amount of posted content relates to the total amount of users at a given time.</li>
                </ol>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>If your Pod is connected to a USB camera and has Room Occupancy enabled (Features settings), the following room occupancy data can be collected. As a note, room occupancy data is only tracked as an aggregate numerical value. No image or video ever leaves the Solstice Pod.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Average Hourly Occupancy</b>: 
						The average number of people detected in the room each hour. Hour increments are determined at the top of the hour. For example, 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. If a meeting runs from 1:45 p.m. to 2:15 p.m., the number of people in the room will be averaged in to both the 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. calculations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Peak occupancy</b>: 
						The maximum number of people that have been detected in the room during the course of the meeting.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <p>The data you selected displays on the graph. On the Y-axis, if there is a significant difference in the magnitude of the numbers that need to be graphed for the two selections, the numbers on the left side of the graph are for the first (blue) selection and the numbers on the right side of the graph are for the second (green) selection.</p>

                <p>By default, data from all the Pods being managed in Solstice Cloud is included in the graphs. You can include or exclude data for a specific Pod or Pods by manually checking or unchecking the box to the left of the Pod name in the Displays table.</p>
                <p class="note">Only selected Pods are included in the data that is graphed. However, all Pods currently listed in the Displays table, which can be either checked or unchecked, will be included in the CSV export.</p>
                <p>You can also check or uncheck the "select all" box to the left of the first column header to select or clear all checked Pods.</p>
