        <h1>Solstice Ink</h1>
        <p>Available in the mobile version of the Solstice App (for iOS and Android devices), Solstice Ink allows users to highlight and temporarily mark up content on the Solstice display from anywhere in the room by simply pointing and drawing with their smartphones. This feature is also supported in moderator mode. As a note, this feature not supported on tablets.</p>

        <p>Solstice Ink has three modes of use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Pointer:</b> By default when you select <b>Ink</b> from the mobile app's menu bar, your mobile device will be in pointer mode. Simply move your device to move the pointer on the Solstice display.</li>
            <li><b>Ping:</b> Press the <b>Ping</b> button to pulse the pointer. Slide your finger from the button toward the center red dot for a continuous pulse, and then press the <b>Ping</b> button again to stop continuous pulse.</li>
            <li><b>Temporary markup:</b> Press and hold the <b>Draw</b> button to draw a temporary markup on the Solstice display, then release the draw button once you are done. Solstice will smooth out your markup after you have finishing drawing it, and the markup will fade away after a short amount of time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While in Ink mode, you can swipe left and right to toggle between Draw and Ping mode. To exit Ink mode, simply click on another option in the Solstice app menu bar.</p>
