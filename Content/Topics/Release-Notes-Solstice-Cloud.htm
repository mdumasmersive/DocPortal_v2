        <h1>Solstice Cloud Release Notes</h1>
        <p>Release notes for Solstice Cloud are shown below, with the most recent release first.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">May 25, 2021</p>
        <p><b>USB Device Page.</b> The new USB Device page has been launched to provide visibility into all USB devices that are plugged into Solstice Pods across your deployment, showing online/offline status, current firmware version, and more. USB A/V devices (such as cameras, audio devices, etc.) must be plugged into Pods via USB 2.0 or 3.0. These connected USB A/V devices are required to utilize features such as Solstice Conference, occupancy data, and occupancy-based power management. For a full list of supported A/V devices, see our supported peripheral list.</p>
        <p><i>Coming soon: Solstice Cloud administrators will be able to set up email alerts when USB devices are unplugged/plugged in.</i>
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">April 21, 2021</p>
        <p><b>Category Sorting Options.</b> When filtering by categories (such as Room Type, City, etc.), you can now sort the order in which the category options appear, either by Pod count (default) or alphabetically. In Solstice Cloud, open the filter drawer and expand any category to see a drop-down menu allowing you to choose sort order.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">April 14, 2021</p>
        <p>Additional configuration options are now available in Solstice Cloud Management.
</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fully Qualified Name (FQDN)</b> in the Welcome Screen (Manage &gt; Templates &gt; Welcome Screen). For deployments where it’s important to show the FQDN of a Pod in the connection instructions to users, you can now enable this within the Welcome Screen template. Requires Solstice 5.3 or later for support. </li>
            <li><![CDATA[
]]><b>Disable Captive Portal Checking</b> in the Security template (Manage &gt; Templates &gt; Security). For networks that do not utilize captive portals and want to disable the URL check that detects captive portals, you can now do so in the Security template. Requires Solstice 5.3 or later for support.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">April 13, 2021</p>
        <p><b>New Room Intelligence Template.</b> This new template was launched to support a number of existing Solstice Pod configuration options as well as upcoming capabilities. The following configuration options have been moved from the Features template to the Room Intelligence template (Manage &gt; Templates). 
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable Solstice Conferencing
</li>
            <li>Enable Location Services
</li>
            <li>Enable Occupancy Data
</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">Although these options were moved, no configuration state has changed. However, you may need to create new templates within Room Intelligence to manage these settings in bulk.
</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">April 8, 2021</p>
        <p><b>Buildings View</b> is now available in the Location management page (Manage &gt; Location). Now within the table, you can select to view your organization’s list of buildings which shows address, city, country, and number of Pods for each building. You can also edit the building names to a nickname that will be easily recognizable to  Solstice users. This provides better visibility into your locations; however, you can still view the list of Pods within the table for more granular information. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">March 24, 2021</p>
        <p><b>User Trends Analytics</b> page launched in Solstice Cloud to provide insight into how end users of Solstice are engaging with meeting and learning spaces. New Analytics data cards include:</p>
