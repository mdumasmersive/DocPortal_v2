        <h1>Solstice Conference</h1>
        <p>Solstice Conference is a software-enabled capability that integrates Solstice with any conferencing solution to provide a simple, intuitive experience when meeting with remote attendees. With agnostic conferencing support, Solstice works with all major conference solutions (Zoom, Teams, GoToMeeting, etc.).</p>
        <p>Solstice Conference also wirelessly connects the room’s camera and audio setup to a user’s laptop device when they host a web conference with remote attendees. Simply plug the room’s USB-enabled camera and/or audio system into the USB ports on the back of the Solstice Pod.</p>
        <p>The in-room display can also be shared to the conferencing session resulting in a unified collaboration experience for both in-person and remote attendees.</p>
        <p>For a streamlined one-step start for meetings, it is recommended to configure the room calendar integration for each Pod, or for end-users to integrate their Microsoft calendar in their Solstice app. When a scheduled meeting on either the room or end-user’s integrated calendar contains a supported conferencing platform’s meeting details, Solstice will be able to use that information to auto-launch the web conference.</p>
